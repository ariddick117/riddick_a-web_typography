# Project 2: Web Typography
## Styling Text on the Web

The focus of the assignment is typography on the web. Students will be given copy
and a few images to work with. The goal is to prepare students for the midterm
project. 

I have designed a page to represent anglers.org by using their colours for the dividers as well as the drop caps. The header type is styled in Arvo which is designed for web and adds a more bold feel to the site.
